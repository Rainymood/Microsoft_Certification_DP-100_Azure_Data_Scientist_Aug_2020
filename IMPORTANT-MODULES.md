# Important Modules

![](./images/canvas.png)

This notebooks contains some notes on modules from the Azure ML Studio that will most likely be on your DP-100 exam. It is a good idea to familiarize yourself with them.

Please note that this list is of course non-exhaustive. This is just a list of the modules of which I know that there are many practice questions about. 

## Data Transformation

### MICE

For each missing value, this option assigns a new value, which is calculated by using a method described in the statistical literature as "Multivariate Imputation using Chained Equations. With a multiple imputation method, each variable with missing data is modeled conditionally using the other variables in the data before filling in the missing values. In contrast, in a single imputation method (such as replacing a missing value with a column mean) a single pass is made over the data to determine the fill value.
