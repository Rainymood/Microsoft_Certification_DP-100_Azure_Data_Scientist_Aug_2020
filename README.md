# Azure Data Scientist

This repository contains my notes for preparing the exam [DP-100: Designing and Implementing a Data Science Solution on Azure](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/exam-dp-100.aspx). If you pass this course you become a **Microsoft Certified Azure Data Scientist Associate**.

The exam consists of roughly 60 questions, 45 of which are Q&A and 15 represent a usecase. You have 3 hours (180 minutes) to answer all the questions. 

Most of the questions in the exam can be broken down into four separate categories:
* Azure ML studio (modules, autoML, designer, etc.)
* Machine learning (PCA, Correlation, metrics, cross-validation, etc.)
* Python (scikit-learn, pandas, etc.)
* Azure Products (Databricks, Data Factory, Virtual machine, etc.)

Here is an overview of the study material I used and recommend.
